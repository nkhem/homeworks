- create a website that meshes features of Change.org with Democracy.io
- from Democracy.io - the point of hte website is to make it really easy to email your congress-person about issues of import
- like twitter, you follow people and organizations that you believe in,
and you can see their activities and encouragement to/arguments for why you should send emails on certain issues
- when you submit the email to congress, you have the option whether or not
to make your email public and/or to include a box asking "Why is this important to you?" which gives you a forum to make the argument to your followers on the issue
- set up is similar to change.org
- opening page will be "what do you care about" with hover-over picture buttons for different issues.
- also, a feature that shows you your congress-person's voting habits and ideological leanings, to give you an idea about which issues you should focus on organizing around
- also, a map feature with events displayed - protests, Know Your Rights events, speaker series and socially-relevant conferences
- checkbox at the bottom of your email to your congressperson, "Make this an available template for others?"
